    <h3>The Short</h3>
    <p>I've worked most of my life to carve my own path, and each stride is greater than the last. I moved myself out of Southern California up to the Greater Seattle Area in November 2016 with nothing more than my car, clothes, and my computer. Since then I've found myself with the determination and skills to properly take on the challenge of meaningful career advancement while still young, having experience already working with Microsoft for a short time, then learning the necessary skills to start my career in Web Development. With a perfectionists drive and a desire to forge measurable progress, I'm looking for the next opportunity where I can make meaningful breakthroughs, amelioration, and growth.</p>

    <h3 class="white-text">The Fluffy Intro</h3>
    <p class="white-text text-justify">I've worked most of my life to carve my own path, and each stride is greater than the last. I moved myself out of Southern California up to the Greater Seattle Area in November 2016 with nothing more than my car, clothes, and my computer. Since then I've found myself with the determination and skills to properly take on the challenge of meaningful career advancement while still young, having experience already working with Microsoft for a short time, then learning the necessary skills to start my career in Web Development. With a perfectionists drive and a desire to forge measurable progress, I'm looking for the next opportunity where I can make meaningful breakthroughs, amelioration, and growth.</p>

    <h3 class="white-text">The Short Enough Professional Summary</h3>
    <p class="white-text text-justify">
        Out of Highschool I knew that I couldn't afford to go to school, so I wanted to work. I moved out at 18 to live with my uncle in Temecula, CA and found my first job at a local grocery store. Even though I started out as a bagger with no experience, I worked extremely hard and earned myself a promotion to the Deli within two months. After working at the store for almost a year, I moved to a slightly less paying job working at a local Sports Bar as a dishwasher, just so that I could have a full 40 hour work week.
        <br><br>
        Starting right as the American football season began, I had to compete against another more experienced dishwasher and earn my spot at work before the slow season came in. And that I did, and as I continued to work hard, my boss recognized my potential. When I expressed wanting to move to Washington State to pursue working in IT, he asked me if I had a plan. I had already budgeted out how much I would need, milestones I needed to hit, including a certification to help get my foot in the door. Impressed, he invested in me, paying for my CompTIA A+ certification, knowing I was bound for bigger and better things.
        <br><br>
        I spent the rest of 2016 self studying for the A+ Cert exam, and working towards my goals to get me into Washington by the end of the year. Despite a major car related setback, I was able to finally land in Shoreline Washington in November. At 20 years old, I had one month with an Airbnb, no friends or connections as a safety net, and only a two seater cars worth of belongings driving me towards success. Within 2 weeks I managed to secure a job at Amazon fulfilling two hour delivery orders over over the Winter. 
        <br><br>
        By early 2017, I ran into more hurdles, when my old car finally bit the dust, and to top it off, my computer's power supply died on me. With barely any money left over after buying a new car, I made efforts to look into a new job, as the hours at Amazon had become increasingly competitive. Come March, I had finally landed a gig in tech as a QA Tester at Pole To Win International, playing video games! I made myself as available as possible, and after a few off and on short test cycles, I managed to work myself onto the larger full time project in the building. With word that the project was going to end come October, I started looking once again for my next stepping stone opportunity.
        <br><br>
        On a whim, I applied for an it position, which turned into my first big time opportunity with a short contract position working at Microsoft for 343 Industries (the makers of the Halo video game franchise). In just a short year, I had worked myself all the way up to exactly where I had wanted to end up! In the short time I was there, I worked as diligently as I could, and was introduced to a much more expansive set of roles from the people I met there. Coding had been on my radar, but it really caught my eye by the time I was ready to leave in February 2018, and in a big way.
        <br><br>
        All three of my roommates were revved up and ready to start the journey into a coding bootcamp, and I was the only one in the house who wasn't signed on. Everything lined up, and it felt like a perfect opportunity, so I jumped on it. The bootcamp was 14 weeks long and focused on Full Stack Web Development. I personally spent well over 60, sometimes even 70 hours a week crash coursing 3 different programming languages over the duration, consisting of Python, with Flask and Django, the Javascript based MEAN stack, and C#'s ASP.NET Core Framework. Every 4 weeks we had an exam, and of the 3 languages, I scored in the 90th percentile.
        <br><br>
        After finishing in late June, I tried applying every which way, hoping to land a hook. By Fall I had run out of funds and needed to find any work ASAP. I took a job working with League of Legends providing Technical Player Support, but by the time on boarding ended, I was just shy of their cutoff, and was unfortunately let go in late November. Not too soon after, I was recommended a contract working with Nintendo of America as an Associate Product Tester. I started at the position in the beginning of January 2019, and that's where I am today, looking to finally break my way into a Junior Developer role!

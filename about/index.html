    <h3 class="white-text">The Short</h3>
    <p class="white-text text-justify">I've worked most of my life to carve my own path, and each stride is greater than the last. I moved myself out of Southern California up to the Greater Seattle Area in November 2016 with nothing more than my car, clothes, and my computer. Since then I've found myself with the determination and skills to properly take on the challenge of meaningful career advancement while still young, having experience already working with Microsoft for a short time, then learning the necessary skills to start my career in Web Development. With a perfectionists drive and a desire to forge measurable progress, I'm looking for the next opportunity where I can make meaningful breakthroughs, amelioration, and growth.</p>
    <h3 class="white-text">The Not-So-Short</h3>
    <p class="white-text text-justify">
        Out of Highschool and wanted to work. First job at grocery store, promoted in 2 months. After almost a year, I moved forward to a different job to work full time hours.
        <br><br>
        Competed against other more experienced dishwasher and earner my spot as the slow season came in. As I continued to work hard, boss recognized my potential, and when I expressed wanting to move to WA to pursue working in IT, he invested in me and my potential.
        <br><br>
        Moved away shortly after I turned 20 years old up to WA. had one guarenteed month of rent down, and found a job within that time. Worked hard during the busy season but kept looking forward to finally getting closer to my industry.
